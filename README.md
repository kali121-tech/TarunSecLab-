## Introduction

I am passionate about starting my journey in cybersecurity, with a strong interest in penetration testing (pentesting). As someone who is new to the field, I am eager to learn about network security, ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments, and exploit development. What excites me the most about cybersecurity is the challenge of thinking like an attacker to identify and fix security weaknesses before they can be exploited. I am particularly drawn to ethical hacking because it combines problem-solving, technical skills, and creativity to strengthen digital defenses.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Penetration Tester.
Understand the Basics of Cybersecurity – Learn foundational concepts such as networking, Linux, and scripting.
Master Essential Pentesting Tools – Get hands-on experience with tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, and SQLmap.
Explore Web and Network Security – Study OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and perform network reconnaissance.
Promote Ethical Hacking Practices – Follow legal guidelines and learn how to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.
